-Node Version 16.3.0 -The App is running in http://localhost:3000/

-I would recommend that you clone the project and then browse into the master branch

-First install the dependencies for the FE by browsing to 'client' folder and typing in the terminal npm install. You might also need to install "npm i yup" & "npm i @hookform/resolvers" ( I needed to do it when I cloned the Project, so just keep it in mind) What's more browse into the "server" folder and type in the terminal "npm install" to install any dependencies.

-To start the application please browse to the "server" folder and type in the terminal "npm start" to start the BE and also browse to the "client" folder and type in the terminal "npm start" to start the FE.
